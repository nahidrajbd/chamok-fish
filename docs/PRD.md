Product Requirement Document (PRD)
Before initiating any application development, a comprehensive Product Requirement Document (PRD) is crucial. This document serves as a blueprint, detailing the application's purpose, features, and functionalities from a user's perspective. It is recommended to articulate the application's concept in simple terms to a large language model (LLM) and leverage its capabilities to generate a detailed PRD.

Here is a comprehensive **Product Requirement Document (PRD)** for the Chamak Fish Feed website, built from all the brand information you have shared.
